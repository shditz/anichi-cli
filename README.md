## 📦 Requirements

Before installing Anichi, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Node.js** version `18.0.0` or higher.
2.  **MPV Player** (Recommended for the best experience).
3.  **yt-dlp** (Required for MPV to stream video links).

> 💡 **Note**: Without `yt-dlp`, MPV cannot open most streaming links, and Anichi will automatically fallback to your web browser.

## 🛠️ Setup Guide: MPV & yt-dlp

For the best experience, using **MPV** is highly recommended.

### Windows (Recommended: Chocolatey)

1.  **Install Chocolatey** (Run PowerShell as Admin):

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```

2.  **Install Tools**:
    ```powershell
    choco install mpv yt-dlp -y
    ```

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
# Install Homebrew if needed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install MPV and yt-dlp
brew install mpv yt-dlp
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mpv yt-dlp -y
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❓ "MPV Player tidak ditemukan" (MPV Not Found)

- **Solution**: Ensure MPV is installed and added to your system PATH. If installed in a custom location, set it manually:
  ```bash
  anichi config set playerPath "C:\Path\To\Your\mpv.exe"
  ```

### ❓ Video doesn't play / MPV closes immediately

- **Cause**: You likely do not have **yt-dlp** installed.
- **Solution**: MPV requires `yt-dlp` to extract direct video streams from hosting sites. Install it using commands in the [Setup Guide](#-setup-guide-mpv--yt-dlp) above. If `yt-dlp` is missing, Anichi will automatically fallback to opening the video in your browser.

### ❓ "Rate Limiting" / "Too Many Requests"

- **Cause**: The API has rate limits to prevent abuse.
- **Solution**: Anichi has built-in delays and caching. Avoid rapidly switching pages (mashing Next/Prev) to allow the cooldown to reset.

### ❓ Pagination stuck or wrong data

- **Solution**: Clear the cache to fetch fresh data:
  ```bash
  anichi cache clear
  ```
